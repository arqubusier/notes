Selected Test Results

What works

Menu, authorization process, downloading files, viewing files

What does not

Installation out of the box, but has workaround

Workarounds

Install in a wine 32 prefix. Install the 4.5.0 version, since version 4.5.9 will not install giving an error "Adobe Digital Editions is already running". You laso need to install additional packages using winetricks and run a command to solve graphics glitch issue

1. Create clean wine32 prefix
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine32" WINEARCH=win32 wine wineboot   

2. Install packages required for the installation
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine32" winetricks corefonts dotnet40    

3. Download Adobe Digital Editions version 4.5.0 from https://filehippo.com/download...

4. Install it
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine32" WINEARCH=win32 wine ADE_4.5_Installer.exe 

5. Fix graphics glitches
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine32" winetricks ddr=gdi 

What was not tested

Everything else

Hardware tested

Graphics:

    GPU: Nvidia
    Driver: proprietary

** USB IN A NUTSHELL

Taken from this excellent write-up at https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml.


*** Chapter 1

Brief overview off all chapters in the usb-standard and what you *really* need to read.
In short, the most important, and useful chapters of the usb-standard when designing peripheral devices are chapters (in addition to the material in the discussed guide):

- 2, Terms and Abbreviations
- 4, Architectural Overview
- 5, USB Data Flow Model (useful information, but a bit long)
- 7, Elecrical (only device speed identification is important)
- 8, Protocol Layer (only status reporting, and handshaking)
- 9, USB Device Frame Work (the most useful chapter, read in detail)


**** Topolgy
- One master -- called *host* in usb -- per network -- called *bus* in usb.
- OTG (On-The-Go), multiple entities on a single link can negotiate over who will be the host (eg. for mobile phone)
- 127 devices per bus.
- tiered star topology, use hubs to extend network

**** Data Link and Physical
- Serial bus
- 4 wires: +5V, GND, D+, D-
- D+ and D-, differential signaling pair
- NRZI (non-Return to zero) encoding
- synch field to synchronize host and reciever
 
**** Plug And Play
- hotplug
- host loads and unloads driver automatically
- PID/VID, Product ID, Vendor ID, used by host to determine correct driver.
- Pay USB Implementor's form to get PID and VID
- or search for existing suitable PID/VID for non-commercial projects.

**** Transfer modes
- Control
- Interrupt
- Bulk
- Isochronous, reserve bandwidth (eg. audio, video aplication)

*** Chapter 3

USB uses standard colors for the wires.
| Pin Number | 	Cable Colour | Function  |
|------------+----------------------+-----------|
|          1 | red                  | VBUS (5V) |
|          2 | white                | D-        |
|          3 | green                | D+        |
|          4 | black                | ground    |

**** Physical

The transmitter signals according to the following tables.

Low speed:
| value | state | d+  [v] | d+ pull-down [ohm] | d- [v] | d- pull-up [ohm] |
|-------+-------+---------+--------------------+--------+------------------+
|     1 | k     | > 2.8   | 15K                | < 0.3  | 1.5K             |
|     0 | j     | < 0.3   |                    | >  2.8 |                  |

High speed:
| value | state | d+  [v] | d+ pull-down [ohm] | d- [v] | d- pull-up [ohm] |
|-------+-------+---------+--------------------+--------+------------------+
|     0 | k     | < 0.3   |                    | >  2.8 |                  |
|     1 | j     | > 2.8   | 15K                | < 0.3  | 1.5K             |

Reciever

| state | d+ d- relationship |
|-------+--------------------|
| k     | d+ - d- >= + 200mV |
| j     | d- - d+ <= + 200mV |

characteristic impedance of 90 ohms +/- 15%

**** Speed identification

A usb device annouces its prescence and speed on the bus by pulling either D+ or D- to 3.3v.
- Full Speed: d+ is pulled to 3.3v by the device.
- Low Speed:  d+ is pulled to 3.3v by the device.
The pull-ups can be implemented in silicon, for instance in usb-transcievers.

Highspeed mode: more complicated...

**** Power

- 1 unit load = 100mA.
- Low-power bus functions: <= 1 unit load; 4.4v <= Vbus <= 5.25
- High-power bus functions: <= 1 unit load @ configuration, <= 5 unit loads @ operation;  4.75v <= Vbus <= 5.25.
- Self powered bus functions: <= 1 unit load at all times, the rest may come from external source.

decoupling capacitance must be between 1uF and 10uF.

**** Suspend mode
- All devices must support this mode
- Entered when there is no activity for > 3.0ms
- After suspend triggered, the device must be fully suspended within 7.0ms
- max load on the bus <= 500uA.
- This includes quiecsent current, due to required pull-downs on D- and D+ at upstream, and pullups on D- or D+ on device.
- Host sends keep-alive packets during normal operation
- Global Suspend
- Selected Suspend
 
**** Data Signalling Rate 
- High speed data is clocked at 480.00Mb/s with a data signalling tolerance of ± 500ppm.
- Full speed data is clocked at 12.000Mb/s with a data signalling tolerance of ±0.25% or 2,500ppm.
- Low speed data is clocked at 1.50Mb/s with a data signalling tolerance of ±1.5% or 15,000ppm.

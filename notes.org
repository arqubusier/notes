** USB IN A NUTSHELL

Taken from this excellent write-up at https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml.


*** Chapter 1

Brief overview off all chapters in the usb-standard and what you *really* need to read.
In short, the most important, and useful chapters of the usb-standard when designing peripheral devices are chapters (in addition to the material in the discussed guide):

- 2, Terms and Abbreviations
- 4, Architectural Overview
- 5, USB Data Flow Model (useful information, but a bit long)
- 7, Elecrical (only device speed identification is important)
- 8, Protocol Layer (only status reporting, and handshaking)
- 9, USB Device Frame Work (the most useful chapter, read in detail)


**** Topolgy
- One master -- called *host* in usb -- per network -- called *bus* in usb.
- OTG (On-The-Go), multiple entities on a single link can negotiate over who will be the host (eg. for mobile phone)
- 127 devices per bus.
- tiered star topology, use hubs to extend network

**** Data Link and Physical
- Serial bus
- 4 wires: +5V, GND, D+, D-
- D+ and D-, differential signaling pair
- NRZI (non-Return to zero) encoding
- synch field to synchronize host and reciever
 
**** Plug And Play
- hotplug
- host loads and unloads driver automatically
- PID/VID, Product ID, Vendor ID, used by host to determine correct driver.
- Pay USB Implementor's form to get PID and VID
- or search for existing suitable PID/VID for non-commercial projects.

**** Transfer modes
- Control
- Interrupt
- Bulk
- Isochronous, reserve bandwidth (eg. audio, video aplication)
